Mission Briefings:

Mission 1: Fail Safe

Message from Ghost Stalker:

"Commander, you have been select to lead the clan under this dire circumstance.

One of our hovels has not reported to us for two days. Given that our scouts have recently reported Nod movement in our Red Zone, I fear these two events conincide.
We must try and make contact with the Hovel. Guide me to it and we can plan our next move there.

If Nod has set up in the wasteland, they must have brought in valuable commucation equipment. We may be able to use it help our search for other Forgotten."

Message Ends.

Objectives:

1.Investigate the Mutant Hovel.

2.Kill any Nod units you find.

3.Capture any Operation Centers in the area.


Mission 2: Angel of the Damned

Message from Ghost Stalker:

"It seems that CABAL has turned against Nod. According to the Nod records we recovered, he is already targetting Forgotten Villages in our Red Zone.
We must reach these villages and prevent the cyborgs from killing the inhabitants.

We are aware that Death Dealer and her followers are in the area. She was my rival and a supporter of Nod during the Second Tiberium War.
These are desperate times, so we must convince her that CABAL is too greater threat for us to fight alone.

To make matters worse, the Nod EVA we have...borrowed...is already deteriorating due to CABAL's interference.
We must contact and ally with all Mutants in the area before we lose the EVA completely, we have no other means to coordinate with them."

Message Ends.

Objectives:

1.Complete the mission before the Nod mission goes offline.

2.Ghost Stalker must survive.

3.Bring Ghost Stalker to the villages and defend them.


Mission 3: New Utopia

Message from Ghost Stalker:

"That piece of s*** Nod EVA died on us. We are back to square one commander, so we need to look elsewhere to find a solution to our command issues. 

I have struck a deal with a GDI commander in Germany. In return for our support in defending their city, GDI will provide us with a stablised GDI EVA unit.

The GDI base is critical to the reclamation effort GDI has begun. They have made so much progress that they have called this area 'The First Blue Zone'. 
We cannot allow CABAL to destroy everything they have worked for...who knows...maybe GDI will find a cure for our people in the long run."

Message Ends.

Objectives:

1.Protect the GDI Construction Yard and our Command Post.

2.Eliminate CABAL's forces in the city.

2.Destroy CABAL's North-Eastern Outpost.

4.Destroy CABAL's main base.


Mission 4: Soulless Citadel

Transmission from GDI Southern Cross:

"Commander, thank you for helping protect the first Blue Zone from the cyborg scum. We need your help again to take down CABAL once and for all.

The leader of Nod, Anton Slavik, has approached us with a ceasefire becuase of CABAL's threat against humanity. I don't trust him, but we cannot take on CABAL alone.

We have come to an agreement where we will stage a two pronged assualt on CABAL's core. Before we do that, we must take out his key inferstructures.
GDI will plant a virus into CABAL's comm network, and destroy his cyber processing plant. Nod, meanwhile, will destroy CABAL's mass harvesting operation, starving the machine of vital resources.

Unoffically, we need your clan to capture CABAL's Tech Centers so our Engineers can erase the advanced tech within them.
We must not give Nod the chance to steal CABAL's researach and bolster their arsenal.

We have tried to assualt his Tech Base before, which ended in failure. However, you may be able to locate and recapture GDI structures to help your efforts in attacking the base.

Good luck.

General Cortez"

Mission 5: The Battle of Open Wound

Message from Ghost Stalker:

"I'm sorry your last mission ended abruptly Commander.

Death Dealer has once again sided with Anton Slavik. I can't say I'm surprised but I hoped she would have done what is right by the Forgotten.

Does she not remember how Nod treated Tratos before they had him killed? I don't care if CABAL ordered the assassination...Nod is to blame for our plight!

The death of CABAL is allowing our people to recover and reorganise. She must not be allowed to break us apart ever again.

Go to her homeland. Kill those who are faithful to her and end her regin of terror. Nothing more, nothing less."

Your mission is simple. Kill Anton Slavik."
