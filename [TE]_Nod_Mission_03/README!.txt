These missions were made by me, CnC_Fin. You may edit these missions if you wish, but you may not
publish your modified version without my permission, or at lest without giving me credit for the
originals.

These missions were made with C&C3 Worldbuilder during years 2012 and 2013, and with TE mod 1.51 beta.
I'll try my best to update these missions when new versions of Tiberium Essence mod are published.

The awesome Tiberium Essence mod is made by Carnius.
