*Fixes made July 8th 2015*

Nod Mission 03 - Phoenix Base
- Fixed error, which caused mission defeat when Command Post was captured with the Saboteur. You should no longer lose when capturing this building.
- Fixed error, which didn't display Objective 3. It is now shown properly.

- Minor map.str file fixes with all three Nod Missions.
