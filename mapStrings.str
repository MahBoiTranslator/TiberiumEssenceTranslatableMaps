Our communication network is linked to Nod's for this mission, it would be wise to attack together to minimise losses. \n \nI...won't be able to give you much to work with.

"Message from Ghost Stalker: \n 'Commander, thank you for staying with us. The Forgotten would not survive if you had left with Death Dealer. \n I've recieved a strange transmission from an unknown source, claiming that Archon and Umagon have been taken to Cairo. \nWith Tratos falling ill and being taken care of on the Kodiak, I've been elected to lead our people until Tratos feels better. \nWe cannot attack Nod head-on, so we will move under the cover of an Ion Storm to build a base on the outskirts of Cairo. This will prevent Nod from detecting us and putting our people at risk. The base will help blockade the city and make a rescue operation in Nod's second city easier. \nOnly you and I will enter the city, as I dont want to risk losing more than with have already. If the records recovered at Vega's Operation Centre are accurate, we should have the exact location of the Nod prison in Cairo. No doubt Umagon and Archon will have been taken there. With luck (and the Ion Storm) on our side, this should be a straightforward mission. \nI'm counting on you, my friend.'"
