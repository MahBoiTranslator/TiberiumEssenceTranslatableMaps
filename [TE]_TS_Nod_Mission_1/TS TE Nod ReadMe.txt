Thank you for downloading the my Tiberian Sun Slavik vs Hassan campaign for Tiberium Essence.

ALthough these missions play similarly to their originals, I have adapted them to suit the Tiberium Essence game machanics and added in my own artistic style to the maps.

Mission 1: Secure the Area

Hassan is determined to stop you at any cost.
He has pursued us back to a small base near his HQ. 
We must fend off his assault and build a Tiberium Refinery so we have the means to strike back.

Objective One: Get production online by building a Tiberium Refinery.
Objective Two: Destroy all of Hassan's Elite Guard.


Mission 2: Retaliation

Hassan spreads his propaganda to the Brotherhood through a nearby TV station. 
With the Brotherhood in chaos, the opportunity to divide Hassan from his followers presents itself. 
Capture the TV station and those once loyal to Kane's technology of peace will return to the fold. 
And as for Hassan's pathetic guards - crush them.

Objective One: Capture the TV station to the east.
Objective Two: Destroy Hassan's Elite Guard.


Mission 3: Free The Rebel Commander

We have become aware of an imprisoned commander in this region who WAS loyal to Hassan. 
Free him and his forces and they should be sympathetic to our cause - and help in the capture of Hassan. 
The commander may have information vital to Hassan's movement.

Objective One: Locate and free the Rebel Nod Commander.


Mission 4: Destroy Hassan's Temple

The Infidel, Hassan, has been tracked to this region of Cairo. Build a base and eliminate this would-be pharaoh, the pretender to Kane's throne.

Objective One: Cross the bridge and destroy the enemies on the far side.
Objective Two: Deploy your MCV and begin building a base.
Objective Three: Locate and destroy Hassan's Temple.


Good luck, Commander Slavik.
