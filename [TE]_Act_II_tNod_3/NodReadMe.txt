Thank you for downloading the Act II Nod Camapaign.


Mission 1: Faithless

Ajay:
'Kane has gone mad. Ordering Nod forces to attack our own if they dare attack the invaders? Shit don't make sense no more.
I'm going to do right by the Brotherhood. Not by trying to take control of it, no...but by saving it from itself.
I'm sorry Kilian. I should've trusted you. But now I'm got bury these aliens or send them back to space.
All in your name.'

Objective 1: Defend the Nod base by destroying the invaders

Objective 2: Capture the Nod Hangar

Objective 3: Destroy the alien base



Mission 2: Hopeless

Ajay:
'Looks like we're not heading to Italy yet.
We picked up a distress call from Nod forces in Egypt. An officer there believes they found something that will give a clue about the Alien's identify.
Seems the Aliens know something is wrong. They've dispatched a large army to keep their secrets buried.
They must be taking this seriously...I'm sure all the Aliens are meant to be protecting their towers now.
I just hope GDI don't show up as well, they defeated us here not long ago.
I fear they will do the same again.

Kilian...the end is coming. I hope my actions save the Brotherhood before I perish.'
