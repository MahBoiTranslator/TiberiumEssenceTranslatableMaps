		Happy Holidays !

At last the GDI Demo is finally here, with the two
missions from the original Tiberian Sun Demo:

-Initiation;
-Clean Sweep;

Moreover they all have easy and hard mode too!
I hope you enjoy these maps and feel free 
to leave a review as it's what the campaigns 
will look like. About them, I believe it is possible 
to mod the music, textures, models and so on, with only 
a big file while using another mod. It's sure that I'll try
to put the original music & cutscenes into C&C 3. 
For now the only modded support I can rely on is 
the awesome Tiberium Essence mod from Carnius.
