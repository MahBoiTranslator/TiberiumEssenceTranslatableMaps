Mission 1: Into Sanctuary


"Slavik is dead! The tratior Marcion sent an assassin to kill Kane's choosen heir!.

As you served him well during the Firestorm Crisis, you were Slavik's most trusted commander.
You must lead the True Black Hand away from the skirmishes between Marcion's followers and Ghost Stalker's clan.

Death Dealer is waiting bring your remaining forces to salvation but you must first 'aquire' a Nod MCV so we can begin to rebuild in our new home.

In the name of Kane."

Objective 3: Bring the stolen MCV to Death Dealer's Outpost

Hints:

Let Maricon's and Ghost's forces fight amongst each other.

Mission 2: Bloody Harvest

***Transmission from Death Dealer***

"You did well. You saved the True Black Hand from the pretender, Marcion and my rival: Ghost Stalker.

Marcion has fled with many former Kane loyalists. Too many to fight. But I sense that he will succumb to Kane's wrath in time.

For now, we need you to rebuild the Black Hand. Those few who followed you will be all that you need for this task.

In your haste to escape, you have few resources to recover from your loses. So you need to do what Nod does best.
Steal my rival's resources by destroying his harvesting operations. Not only will you get all you need to move forward, you will weaken Ghost's influence here.
Slavik had plans for you. Do not fail his memory."

***End Transmission***

Objective: Gather 40,000 credits by destroying Mutant Havesters, Refineries and Silos

Await further orders in the field.

Hints:

Capturing Refineries while a harvester is docked will allow you to capture both.



Mission 3: Distortion

***Transmission from Death Dealer***

"Our greatest enemy has just given us our greatest gift.

By creating the Reclamation Agenda, GDI has proven that is cares not for the Forgotten.

We will announce GDI's intentions to the Mutant world. Not even Ghost can stop what is to come.

Of course, if you transmit the Agenda directly through a Nod channel, the Forgotten will not trust it's authenticity.
You must locate and capture a Mutant Sanctuary, so we may leak the Agenda from a 'trusted' Forgotten Source.

Some of the clans will jump at the chance to strike at GDI, not all are loyal to the fascists out of respect...
Others clans will need more convincing...allow GDI to destroy a mutant clan to ensure that all Forgotten know the dangers of the beast.

Once all mutants are convinced...join them in purging GDI from our lands."

***End Transmission***

Objective 1: Locate and Capture the Mutant Sanctuary.

Objective 2: Allow GDI to destroy a Mutant village.

Objective 3: Destroy the GDI base.

Await further orders in the field.

Hints:

Strike GDI when the iron is hot...



Mission 4: Petrova's Gift

***Transmission from Death Dealer***

"It is time, Commander.

For thousands of years, Kane worked tirelessly to get humanity to the next stage of evolution.
Through his vision and the late Dr Petrova's research I have created the mutagen that will make you Divine like me.
My clan await in the Shrines, ready to remove the taint of human failure once and for all.
They have already been gifted with Tiberium, I will stablise this gift and grant them life eternal.

You must protect me and my work. GDI and ZOCOM have all but destroyed the last of the Forgotten.
Even Ghost himself fell in their bloodlust.
ZOCOM know where we are. They are invading this sacred ground as we speak.
Build you forces quickly and repel them. We will not have another chance at divination.

Kane lives in Death."

Range is your best friend here.



Mission 5: Run Silent

***Transmission from Death Dealer***

"Although time was never on our side...perhaps luck was.

The Divine are born. All that's left is to take them to the remains of CABAL's Core as Kane wished.
The transport carrying the Divine is heading towards the edge of the Red Zone.
Our scouts report that ZOCOM have a large fortress along our route, no doubt capable of detecting the transport.

The only way to ensure the safety of the Divivne is to engage and destroy the fortress.
This will also cause a heavy setback in GDI's Reclamation Agenda.

We lost contact with a Commando team that was searching for the local Ion Cannon Control Centre, find them before we arrive."

***End Transmission***

Await further orders in the field.
