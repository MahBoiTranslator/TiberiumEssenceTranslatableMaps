Here are the first 3 maps of the GDI Campaign from
Tiberian Sun, remade in C&C 3.
This can be considered as a "safety back-up release".
Unfortunately I can't work as much as I want to
on this project and on top of that, the tool I use 
(World Builder) no longer works.

I'm still happy with the results and I apologize
if you were obviously expecting way more from this project.

This rar file contains:
-Reinforce Phoenix's Base;
-Secure the Region;
-Capture the Train Station;

Easy and Hard modes are also implemented.

(I recommend manually installating)

And don't forget to play these maps with the 1.6 TIBERIUM ESSENCE MOD !!!!

I know Tiberium Essence 2.0 is out but these maps were based on the 1.6 version.

		EXTRA

With my experience, I'm making a detailed document on how I
worked on this project. This may be useful for other
map builders. Though, I don't want to rush it so it'll come
out when I feel like it should.
