Overview of map below:
**************************************************

Tired of playing just to avoid superweaopns in the opening? Tired of being on the back foot from the start? This map is for you!

Long story short

Play as player 1 in the SouthEastern (Bottom Right) location. Not the NorthWest or NorthEast (Top Left or Top Right). I'm not insulting you, there is literally no compass on the map. This map is optimised for gameplay against 2 Brutal Skirmish AI, not other players in multiplayer--they will have significant disadvantages unless they're machines. 

**************************************************

Short story long

I made this map to achieve 3 things:

1. Enable building capture when playing as 'Forgotten' in TE V2.

2. Spice up the gameplay with troop diversification through an abandoned NOD base, Mutant coalition partners, roving Marauder patrols and GDI reinforcements. I've added a GDI Surveillance Radar to open up map reveal (but only as long as it survives) and added as close to infinite resource generation as possible to prevent battle tempo stalling at the hands of a tiberium field.

3. Avoid the standard skirmish opening of 'theatre entry' which largely consists of surviving until you can retake the initiative and steamroll your opponent's base from the garbage tactical siting you've been given. You're already at a disadvantage with Brutal AI--you don't have subordinate commanders to move elements for you simultaneously and you don't need to have the point reinforced every single map you play.

In this map you can make your own adventure. 

Use only the facilities provided to you; use none and capture the NOD base instead; surgically dismantle the two Brutal AI or carry out a guerilla warfare campaign to undermine their ability to resource their war of attrition against you. Steamroll them in 20 mins or drag it out indefinitely.

There are two nukes though: 1 will help you in the opening with the Marauder patrols, the other will help you open up another avenue of approach to the NorthEastern enemy position. Keep a look out for them.

The possibilities are endless. The key here is that you have the choice.

The layout of the map is intended to shape the Brutal AI without modding it to be less of a tactical imbecile. I'm not clever enough to fix this. Tiberium fields general shape the AI into base expansion. The AI chases ground like a geographically embarrassed junior Lieutenant when it comes to tiberium fields so I've used this to our advantage. This results in chokepoints being better defended and more mass within the enemy base regardless of which AI personality you choose. The AI won't use the mutant structures but I've placed them down out of courtesy anyway. Ideally you can change them into Reinforcement Bays in World Builder and then the AI will just use the reinforcements as they become available.

Alternatively you can wipe the map clean and simply take advantage of the high ground and natural choke points. Again, choice is yours.

Good luck Commander!
