Mission: Extinguished

Transmission from General Joshua Mitchell

"Commander... Ghost Stalker told me that you disobeyed orders to save his clan.

I'm glad you see things the way I do. While there is Tiberium on Earth Nod, will always be a thorn in our side.
No matter how many times they 'go back to the shadows' or 'break apart and fight each other' they always come back stronger than before.
The Steel Talons aim to extinguish Nod for good. No remorse. No mercy. While the GDI Council sit on their asses, we will take down Nod cell by cell.

The biggest Nod cell is the Black Hand. Under their new leader Marcion, they...could...pose a massive threat to all of GDI.
We must take him down before he can grow his army big enough to threat us. Destroy his stronghold to eliminate the problem.

Ghost will be joining us for this mission. No doubt he wants revenge after Marcion denied the Forgotten the pleasure of killing Slavik."


Objective:

Destroy Marcion's Stronghold

Hint:

Let Ghost have his revenge...
