Thank you for downloading Tiberium Essence Act II Prologue: Rude Awakening.



You awaken with a violent jolt. The all too familiar sound of bombs surrounding your sensitive ears.
As you struggle to come to your senses, all you can see is the shadow of a tall figure. A sickly purple light dominates the rest of your poor vision.
"I must retrieve my recordings!" The figure shouts in a mixture of anger and desperation.
A second figure walks into view, seemingly calm as if they are comfortable in the sounds of destruction.
"Doctor Giraud, Kane just needs your knowledge of Tiberium. Your recordings are of no importance to us." he says with stubbornnes.

"Don't you understand! I must prove what happened to Ghost Stalker and the Forgotten! Now that I am free from ZOCOM...after 13 years I can finally reveal the vile truth to the world!"
Each sentence Giraud speaks betrays the loss of his sanity. His guard escorting him out of the crumbling Secret Shrine your eyes have know adjusted to.

The instant you look at your hands a memory floods back: The Montauk, the bright light of the Ion Cannons...Divination.
You see the shining blue Tiberium flesh that replaced the green you once knew and with it you know that Divination was a success.

Stunned by your appearance another explosion snaps you back to reality.
With only the rambling of a madman giving you a clue to the fate of the clans, you fix your eyes on the exit of the Shrine and rush to reach it before the entire building collapses...
