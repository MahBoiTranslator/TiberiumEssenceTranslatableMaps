Thank you for downloading the Death and the Ghost Campaign for Tiberium Essence 2.0

This campaign is the prequel to my main TE story, and is designed to be the spiritual third campaign for Tiberian Sun.

Important notes about this campaign:

1: There is no EVA throughout the campaign. This is intentional as I think it makes sense that the Forgotten doesn't have the technological skill to build/obtain a tactical AI yet.

2: During some missions, you will have the choice to go with Ghost Stalker's or Death Dealer's units and upgrades. This may also effect mission objectives and outcomes.

3: This campaign will tie together the GDI and Nod campaigns in Tiberian Sun, you will see how and why once you start playing.

4: The radar/mission previews are in black and white, this is for style and uniqueness.

5. Cutscenes are unskippable once started. Sorry! But otherwise you'd be able to break the scene with the camera. So yeah, not sorry. 
   Don't play the cutscenes if you don't care for the story.

Thanks to DeltaV and Firehawk-Ph4ntom for helping compiling certain maps

Thanks to Egozi44 for allowing me to use **** from his Big Bang mod for Kane's Wrath

Enjoy!

Mission 1: Soul Searching

Message from Tratos:
"Congratulations earning this postion, Commander.
As we find more of those like us; those who escaped the horrors of Nod's prisons, it's imperative that we find a place to call home.
One pontentially suitable area is an old industrial site that was ruined during the Tiberium War.
My scouts have reported that GDI and Nod are fighting over the area, so there must be some value left in the site.
Because of this, I'm sending our most experienced warrior, Ghost Stalker, to help you find anything of value.
However, it's unlikely GDI and Nod will take much interest in our presence. To them, we are forgotten."

Objective 1: Find useful salvage in the area

Ghost Stalker must survive


Mission 2: To The Skies

Message from Tratos:
"It looks like we have gained more than just a home.
An unknown, blue-skinned Forgotten, as unique as she is mysterious, has agreed to use her knowledge of Tiberium for the good of our people.
However, she needs her equipment from a GDI lab located in the Arctic Circle.
I know I'm stating the obvious, but we don't have the means to build aircraft that will travel that far.

The only option we have is stealing some of the new GDI transports my scouts have discovered.
Codenamed: 'Carryall', we believe these transports are designed to carry heavy vehicles across great distances.
Two of them are located at a GDI airbase near the new city GDI is building.
Try not to harm the civilians, they are not our enemy."

Objective 1: Capture the GDI Airfields

Objective 2: Destroy the remaining GDI forces 


Mission 3: Rare Winter

Message from ???:
"Commander, thank you for answering my request. I'm glad you're helping me take back what is rightfully mine.
I will use my equipment to help lessen the pain you and your people are going through, but retrieving said equipment will be tough.
The first thing that will kill us is the extreme cold. I know Tiberium isn't well adapted to the cold, so I guess we won't have an easy time either.
The GDI armour we 'borrowed' from the airbase isn't suited for Arctic conditions, but it's better than nothing.

Once we land, I'll need you to guide Ghost Stalker through the GDI checkpoints. I'll help you as much as possible, after all, I used to live and work here."

??? will provide you with objectives as you progress.


Mission 4: Visionary

Message from Tratos:
"I hoped we would never have to see Temple Prime again. But we have no choice.
The Tacitus unlocks secrets to Tiberium that must never be revealed to Nod. I...was tricked by Kane into to translating the device in return for freedom.
GDI began attacking the temple as I was translating, so I was able to hide it as Nod were busy fighting.

GDI are going to be tough to dislodge, so use stealth to reach the Temple if possible. 
Try to get the Tacitus before Nod arrives; we are not ready to face two powerful foes at once.
Good luck, I look forward to seeing you when you get home."

Objective 1: Find the path to Temple Prime


Mission 5: Scrapped Plans

We have recieved a distress call from home. 
Through the garbled tranmission, all we could decipher were these words from Death Dealer: 
'underground', 'taking prisoners' 'Archon and I', and 'meet in the south'.
Returning from Sarajevo, Ghost Stalker and yourself must reach Death Dealer and Archon before assessing the situation. We have no more intel at this time.

Objective 1: Bring Ghost Stalker to Death Dealer and Archon


Mission 6: No To Neutrality

Message from Tratos:
"Commander, I know I'm placing you in an uncomfortable position, but I want you to understand why I need you to do the unthinkable.
Kane himself has informed us that GDI is producing an anti-Tiberium weapon for use against the Forgotten.
Of course, he's probably lying, but such a harrowing claim cannot be left to chance.
I have sent some of our people to a nearby abandoned city, where a Nod agent will deliver supplies for us to seal this alliance.
In return, we will clear the tunnel of GDI forces so that Nod can safely send an MCV and build a base.

I...won't be able to give you much to work with. I still have my doubts about Kane's information so I don't want to lose more precious lives needlessly.
Our more...vocal...warriors with anti-GDI sympathies are eager to join the battle with you. They will arrive periodically.
They may be willing to die in battle, but I want to see them return home. Please be careful, my child."

Objective 1: Clear both sides of the tunnel of GDI forces

Objective 2: Assist Nod in destroying the GDI Research Facility

NOTE: Once Nod builds up their base, you will not be defeated if you lose all your limited forces. You will only be defeated if Nod loses their base.
